# Goals

The main goal of the library is to provide set of primitives that allows its users to build **reasonabley** customized and sophisticated design systems.
The library doesn't provide too low-level abstractions where the user has to go beyond components and pierce into DOM to the point that it would be questionable to use library in first place.
At the same time, it is also not too-high level where the scope of customization is limited where everything looks like a Bootstrap Website.
The core idea is **customization** and as such, each design system should feel unique in its own space.

To achieve this, the library is built around few key principles:
- **Composition** is everything
- Clear distinction between different levels of abstractions
- Readable code for each and every one of us


### Composition
Composition is everything. Do not assume anything about the environment on how component will be used by the user.
Provide components that are open by principle and allow composition in different possible ways with a clearly-defined responsibility and interface.
User may choose to compose low-level components in different ways than the library has composed. So, library should not make any magical/undocumented feature that will never be available to users.


### Level of abstractions
Library provides two types of abstractions - Re-usable algorithms using hooks + functions and UI components that can be used with custom logic.
At prototyping level, library users would often use library as a complete package. But as it grows into a serious product, it is expected that users will pick various abstractions.
The goal of the library to provide extensive guides and enough loose coupling to use these internal abstractions independently.

This goes back to the main goal of composistion where it should be possible for users to compose these independent abstrations easily in a meaningful manner.


### Readable code
It goes without saying - Readable code is the ultimate dream of every engineering team!
