# Roadmap


## Phase 1 - Being Automic and SubAtomic
This is where we build the core of the library. It would exclusively focuse on making great **DX - Developer eXperince** for Preact developers.

- Base library (Basic form controls)
- Intuitive surface system
- Composite widgets<br />
  (Date Picker, Time Picker, Dialog, Dropdown, Select, Multiselect, Notification)
- Keyboard accessibility
- Extensive theme support
- Touch-screen compatible
- Small-screen (mobile) friendly
- Well-defined type definitions


## Phase 2 - Being Molecular
- Reactive router for Preact<br />
  (On the principles of explicit data flows)
- WAI-ARIA accessibility
- Meta-design system
- Connecting the community
- Pre-built packages
- Web Component wrappers


## Phase 3 - Being Granular
- Performance tuning
- Internationalization - i18n
- Localization - l10n
- Connect Africa - Documentation in Swahili and/or other languages


## Outside of Roadmap
- No RTE - It is a different universe. We suggest use ProseMirror, Trix, etc. for this.


## Under consideration
- Data visualization<br />
  (Set of primitives to build your own graphs)
