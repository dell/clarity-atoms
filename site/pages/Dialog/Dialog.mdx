## Dialog - UX Principles

### Make underlying content inaccessible
When any Dialog is open, underlying application content should not be accessible to user by any means unless, the dialog is dismissed.

### Trap the user focus
When the dialog box is opened, the focus of the active element should move to any focusable element within the dialog box.
It means that dialog box should always have at least one focusable element.
