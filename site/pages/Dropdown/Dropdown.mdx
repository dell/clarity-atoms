# Dropdown

Dropdown is used to display a list of choices on a **transient surface**. Building a customization dropdown is one of the most complicated affair.
Clarity Atoms thus provide a set of low-level hooks and components so that you can build your own components. Collectively, these utilities are part of
Surface System provided by Clarity Atoms.<br/><br/>
