# Button

Button is the first element of interaction for user and the most basic building block of any component
system. User interacts with a button using mouse, keyboard or a tap on touch screen interface.

> Button is the first element of application branding.

## Button - UX Principles

### Types of buttons
At a baseline, buttons have **three distinct flavours**. An applicantion using Preactor can
build on these three variations to build it own customized buttons. Following are the three variations.

<ButtonVariation />

Alternately, three buttons types are also recognized as **primary**, **secondary** and **tertiary**
action buttons and are used interchangeably.

### Buttons and Links
Buttons share lots of characteristics with **Links** especially on accessibility and visual experience
front. It is even more evident in case of flat button. However, the guideline is very straight forward.

> Use a link when a user is expected to be taken to a different page.


### Size
Size of a button should consider all the possibilities with which user would interact with an
application. Some users with motor skill disorders have trouble interfacting with buttons if they
are small. It it more evident so with touch interfaces where primary medium of interaction is touch and
users have different finger sizes.

> At minimum, button should be 36px x 36px in size.

Clarity Atoms provide two types of size for buttons viz. **Standard Button** and **Compact Button**:
 - Standard button has 36px height whereas compact button has 24px height.
 - While compact button breaks the minimum 36px height rule, it is sometimes required in edge case
    scenarios like chips, compact filters buttons, etc.
 - The 24px height can be compensated by sufficient width and having enough room space around
    it to avoid accidental mistakes for the user.
 - In general, compact button should be used sparingly.


### States and Behavior
Every button variant must support 4 mandatory states and 1 optional state. The states are as following:

  1. **Normal & enabled** - The natural visual state of the button when user has not interacted with it.
      What it means is - "button should look like a button in a normal state".
  2. **Focused** - The state when the button is the currently active element on the page. The button gets
      focused by various means - Keyboard `tab` key interaction, long tap, partial mouse click, etc.
  3. **Pressed** - A complex state that gets activated when user starts tapping/click the button. It gets
      over when the press action is completed. User should be provided appropriate visual indicator when
      the press action is in process.
  4. **Disabled** - An inactive state where no interaction is allowed with the button.
  5. **Hover** - (Optional) hover state which comes into effect only when mouse is being used. It gets
      activated when mouse is hovered over the button, just before it is being pressed or focused.

Button can always be exactly at one state at a time. So, if button is focused and at the same mouse is
hovered over the button, focused state should override the hover state. The priority of states is:

> `Disabled` > `Pressed` > `Focused` > `Hover` > `Normal`

### Single Line Buttons
Multi-line or long-text buttons should generally be avoided.

### Additional considerations
Buttons, being the first element of design system, has many other considerations such as their placement,
allowed icons within the buttons and their styling, etc. But those are all application experience concerns
and as such not part of the Clarity Atoms. Please refer to your product's UX guidelines or design system.

## Component Props

```ts
export type ButtonVariant = 'solid' | 'outline' | 'flat' | 'minimal';
export type ButtonType = 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset';

export interface ButtonProps {
  // Additional class names to be added
  class?: string;

  // Submit | Rest | Button
  type?: ButtonType;

  // HTML title attribute
  title?: string;

  // Click event handler
  onClick?: () => void;

  // Children items
  children?: ComponentChildren;

  // Stylign props
  disabled?: boolean;
  variant?: ButtonVariant;
  compact?: boolean;

  // Access native DOM Button element
  ref?: Ref<any>;
};
```
